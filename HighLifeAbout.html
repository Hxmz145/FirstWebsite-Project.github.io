    <h1>Our History</h1>
    <img src="OldBuilding.jpg" class="historypic">
    <h1 class="History">1965</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;">In 1965,<br> three brothers embarked on a journey that would shape the course of their lives and establish a lasting legacy.<br> 
        With the help of their father's will, the brothers bought a small property and formed a property management company.<br> 
        Over the years, the company grew in size and reputation,<br> 
        and its commitment to excellence and customer satisfaction became its hallmark.<br> 
        With each passing year, the company expanded its portfolio,<br> 
        taking on new properties and new challenges,<br> 
        always with a steadfast commitment to providing the highest level of service to its clients.
        <br> Today, the company is recognized as a leader in the property management industry,<br> 
        with a reputation for excellence that has endured for decades.<br>
         Despite the many changes that have taken place since its founding,<br> 
         the company remains true to the values and principles that guided its founders,<br>
          and it continues to be driven by a passion for excellence and a dedication to the satisfaction of its clients. </p>
